    "\n",
    "- **SPIMI Algorithm**: Implements the Single-Pass In-Memory Indexing algorithm to efficiently handle large datasets by writing partial indexes to disk.\n",
    "- **Batch Processing**: Indexes documents in batches (`batch_size=10000`) to manage memory usage.\n",
    "- **Precompiled Regular Expressions**: Uses precompiled regex patterns in the tokenizer to improve tokenization speed.\n",
    "- **Stemming Cache**: Caches stemmed tokens to avoid redundant computations during tokenization.\n",
    "- **MessagePack Serialization**: Uses `MessagePack` for efficient binary serialization when writing partial and merged indexes to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Index File Format\n",
    "- **Format**: The index is stored as a MessagePack (`.msgpack`) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structure**:\n",
    "  - **Index**: A dictionary where keys are terms and values are dictionaries mapping document IDs to lists of positions where the term occurs.\n",
    "  - **Document Lengths**: A dictionary mapping document IDs to the total number of tokens in each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The (`.msgpack`) file is a binary format, making it impossible to provide a screenshot of its contents. \n",
